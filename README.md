# Hi! I'm Nate!
Any Pronouns
I am a CS student at SPU. I code the way I talk; Long rambly statements with lots of backtracking and clarifications. One reason why I enjoy coding as much as I do, is because of my love for magic: the gathering, as there are a lot of similarities between the two. casting a spell and calling a method aren't as different as you may think.

I code in both C++ and Java, I have knowledge in scratch from middle school, and I despise html.

If anyone asks what my favorite line of code is:
while (false);
  break;
